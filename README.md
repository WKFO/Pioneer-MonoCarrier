**Monolithic Carrier** (formerly known as **B-Class Escort Carrier**) is a superheavy cargo transport vessel designed and manufactured by Haber Corporation.

Although most Monolithic Carriers are owned by Haber Corporation, it is not entirely uncommon to see other shipping and logistics companies operating them.

Originally designed as a warship, Monolithic Carrier is quite inefficient compared to similarly sized cargo transports, and although they are still provided regular maintenance by Haber Corporation, new ships of this class are no longer being built.

## History
Monolithic Carrier (known at the time as B-Class Escort Carrier) was initially designed as an escort carrier, meaning that its main purpose was to deploy fighter spacecraft for protecting unarmed Haber vessels, or ocassionally, support other Haber warships requiring fighter cover. It saw limited use during the formation of the Solar Federation, but as more and more fighter spacecraft were fitted with hyperdrives later on, Haber lost its interest in fighter carrying platforms. This was also partially a result of Haber Corporation being constantly forced into defensive combat - they had no reason nor opportunity to carry their fighters too far away from home.

The change in military doctrine effectively put most fighter-carrying spacecraft out of service. It was, however, seen as a waste to decommission and dismantle what most Haber personnel referred to as "perfectly functional" spaceships. (In reality, the only perfect thing about them were the amount of headroom one got in its crew quarters, that is, compared to other Haber ships.)

It wouldn't be long until an engineering genius by the name of Antoni Malinowski would come up with the brilliant idea of crossing out the words "B-Class Escort" from the blueprint documents. The idea was that the hangars and fighter maintenance utilities could be simply replaced by, well, empty space, allowing these ships to carry pretty much anything from point A to B. When he told about this idea to his immediate superior Chief Engineer Terry Williams with great excitement, Malinowski was accused of damaging archived documents and reassigned to a less desirable position within the design bureau. Williams, however, would continue to work on Malinowski's idea and also remove the point defense turrets on the (what was formerly an) escort carrier. When presented to the higher ups in the Haber administration, the idea was very liked and Williams was given a promotion to oversee the conversion operations of the new "Carrier" ships. Antoni would take two more years before he could gather up all the secret design documents within his reach and desert to the Solar Federation.

Halfway during the conversion of the very first "Carrier", somebody had the nerves to stand up and utter the words "What a boring name for a boring ship." This eventually lead to the civilian version of the ship being renamed as "Monolithic Carrier", due to its rigidly integrated structure and embedded systems, resulting in a difficult-to-reconfigure design. Anyone with more than half a functioning brain cell could easily notice why this was a bad thing for the conversion operation. In retrospect, most engineers who had to work on the project would agree on dismantling the ships and building ice cream machines would be a better investment for the society.

Unfortunately for Haber, trouble with the Monolithic Carriers would not end there. During the second test flight attempt of the Monolithic Carrier (the first test flight was aborted due to a stuck open coolant valve), a container tug that was trying to fly past the ship had been unlucky enough to be passing in front of the main engine nozzle (and not get noticed by the sensors officer) during engine ignition sequence. Being washed in the highly energetic exhaust jet from the Monolithic Carrier, the tug was almost immediately destroyed. After this disaster, an investigation team came up with the idea of announcing main engine ignition on comms at least one minute before the ignition sequence actually starts. In addition, glowing warning signs have been painted on the hulls of all Monolithic Carriers.
